        It’s interesting to see that the two readings, although 65 years apart,
        seem to echo with each other in a lot of ways. Bush brought up the idea
        of a memory extension machine ( which, in my opinion, kind of resembles
        a google drive) that enables individuals to store, manage and share
        information and data as well as accessing other people’s knowledge base
        through an interconnected system, which, in his opinion, would assist
        humans intellectually and become a new tendency of technological
        advancement after WWII. Bush’s predictions were realized in some ways in
        the decentralized era of Web as described in Tim Berners-Lee’s article,
        but Lee points out that although the internet provides a platform for
        users to access and share information more efficiently, the access is
        not equal depending on the individual user’s socioeconomic status, ISP,
        geographical locations, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although both authors desire a world where information can be shared
        efficiently and accelerate innovation, I was reminded of big tech
        companies like Google which potentially harm the privacy of individual
        users by exploiting user data logs for ad revenues, as described by
        surveillance capitalism, a phrase brought up by Shoshana Zuboff. As
        residents of the Internet, while information creates value we never
        think of, it also puts us at risk of being totally transparent and
        losing sovereignty over the information we wish to store safely.
