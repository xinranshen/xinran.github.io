        Baudrillard points out that the progress in technology and media has
        eliminated our private universes and made explicit every object. These
        made us live in a spectacle society in which both our information
        sovereignty and independent thinking is harmed.

        Marx, however, argues that such explicitness and straight-forwardness,
        or, obscenity, as phrased by Baudrillard, of objects, is a key
        characteristic of consumer society, in which everything has their
        equivalence in the circulation system. So it seems that this obscenity
        is inevitable.

        All these thoughts remind me of Susan Sontag who believes that we should
        return things to their original appearance and not add shallow,
        subjective and stigmatized interpretations of them. In today's society,
        because the presentation of things has become direct or even
        superficial, people are used to subjective judgment rather than rational
        thinking.
